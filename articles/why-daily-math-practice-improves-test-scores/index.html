            <div class="article-intro">
                <p>Research consistently shows that regular, daily math practice significantly improves test scores and overall math performance. The benefits extend beyond just memorizing facts—daily practice builds confidence, reduces test anxiety, and develops problem-solving skills that transfer to standardized tests. This article explores the science behind daily practice and provides practical strategies for implementing it effectively.</p>

                <h2>The Science of Spaced Repetition</h2>
                <p>Cognitive science research demonstrates that spaced repetition—practicing skills over multiple days rather than cramming—leads to better long-term retention. When students practice math daily, they're strengthening neural pathways and moving information from short-term to long-term memory. This is why students who practice consistently perform better on tests than those who study intensively just before exams. Daily practice creates a foundation of knowledge that makes new concepts easier to learn and remember.</p>

                <h2>Building Test-Taking Confidence</h2>
                <p>Test anxiety is a real barrier to success for many students. Daily math practice helps reduce this anxiety by making math problems feel familiar and manageable. When students encounter similar problems on tests, they feel confident because they've practiced these types of questions regularly. This confidence translates to better performance, as students can focus on solving problems rather than worrying about whether they know the material. Regular practice also helps students develop time management skills that are crucial for standardized tests.</p>

                <h2>Transfer of Skills to Test Formats</h2>
                <p>Daily practice with workbooks helps students develop problem-solving strategies that transfer directly to test situations. Workbooks often present problems in formats similar to standardized tests, helping students become comfortable with question types, wording, and problem structures. This familiarity reduces the cognitive load during tests, allowing students to focus on solving problems rather than deciphering unfamiliar formats. Additionally, regular practice helps students identify their weak areas early, giving them time to improve before test day.</p>
